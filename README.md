# ONLINE_FRAUD_TRANSACTION_DETECTION_ML
💳 Online Payment Fraud Detection Dashboard
An interactive and visually enhanced Streamlit dashboard for detecting fraudulent online transactions using a pre-trained machine learning model.


🚀 Features
🌙 Dark/Light Mode Toggle

📥 Upload your CSV file with transaction data

🔍 Predict fraudulent transactions using a trained ML model (fraud_model.pkl)

📊 Visual insights with pie charts, bar plots, histograms, and time series graphs

🎉 Dynamic metrics and glowing animations for better fraud interpretation

💾 Download your prediction results as CSV

📁 File Structure
File	Description
app.py	Main Streamlit application script
fraud_model.pkl	Pre-trained ML model for fraud prediction
online fraud detect.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook containing EDA, model training (not used directly in app)

🧠 Model Input Requirements
Your uploaded CSV should include the same features used during model training. Columns like amount, type, and step enable enhanced visualizations. The app automatically excludes isFraud (if present) before prediction.
